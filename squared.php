			<h2>Where are you at this moment?</h2>
			<p>Currently in the comfort of my own home, with some snacks and the tv on...preparing to catch up on on some Squared work.</p>

			<h2>If you had a choice, where would you be and what would you be doing?</h2>
			<p>On holiday, somewhere hot! Taking some much needed time to relax, not having to worry about schedules or deadlines! I would probably be walking around exploring or I'd be somewhere with good food and drinks.</p>

			<h2>Whatâ€™s your digital/marketing experience?</h2>
			<p>I have marketing experience, my degree was in Advertising with Marketing and Business Studies was one of my A-Levels.</p>
			<p>I've worked in an Ecommerce environment for about 6 years now, so have had some exposure to digital marketing.</p>

			<h2>Why did you choose Squared Online and what do you hope to achieve from the course?</h2>
			<p>I like to learn and it's about time that I brush up and strengthen my marketing skills as I've been focusing hard on code for the last 5 years.</p>
			<p>I have always had an interest in marketing and this was a great opportunity I couldn't turn down. I like that on this course I will get a chance to explore many areas of digital marketing, this will definitely benefit me on a professional level.</p>

			<h2>What do you bring to a team?</h2>
			<p>My tech skills and experience with responsive development should come in handy for the mobile part of Module 2.</p>
			<p>	Other than that, good old fashioned hard work, a creative flair, very cool under pressure, happy to muck in at all levels and help others when needed.</p>
